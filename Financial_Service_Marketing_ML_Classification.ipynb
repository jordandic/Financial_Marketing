    "## Descriptive information for the study and the dataset:\n",
    "<b>Link:</b> http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing <br>\n",
    "<br><b>Study Implications:</b> There are two datasets containing all the instances. bank-full.csv is the chosen one to develop our model since it focuses on information which is less dependent on macro-economic factors. The reasoning behind this is that macro-economic factors will likely dictate how much the bank should scale up or down marketing spend, but it should not be the basis for determining who should be included in the target market. Macro-economic factors are relatively unpredictable and shouldn't necessarily be the basis of developing a target market in any company's overall marketing strategy. Instead, for the purposes of this study, only personal demographic information is used. Furthermore, other demographic information, like 'job' and 'loan,' may be sufficient in reflecting the current implications of the macro-environment on the individual at the micro-level, which is what this study focuses on. In a regression model, the macro-level factors for social and economic context would be included. The ultimate implication of this classification study is to determine which customers are most likely to subscribe to a loan deposit, and therefore how the company ought to select its target market, and how to position its loan products to that cohort. Ultimately, this study will aid the bank in developing it's marketing strategy including decisions related to product, price, place, and promotions. <br>\n",

    "## What is a term deposit?\n",
    ">A term deposit is a hybrid bank account and investment account. It is similar to a bond which yields a relatively low interest rate, but normally has short maturity dates compared to bonds, thereby making them more accessable as cash in the near future. Term deposits will normally mature between one month and a couple years while some bonds can mature in decades. The best example of a term deposit is a CD, or Certificate of Deposit. These instruments are very useful for banks because they provide more dependability of deposits.\n",
    "### Why is dependability of deposits important for banks?\n",
    ">Have you ever heard of a run on a bank? The Great Depression of the early 1900's was partly caused by a nationwide financial scare where everyone was trying to get their money out of the banking system at once. This was detrimental to banks, and is an issue which modern day bank regulators (OCC, Federal Reserve, and local authorities) scrutinize heavily to prevent such economic fallout from ever occurring again. Banks must keep a sufficient amount of money in reserves for both bad loan expenses (defaults) and to meet the withdrawal needs of their customers, or depositors. If there are not sufficient reserves in a bank to meet both of those requirements, and other expenses of the bank, then that bank could fail. So, besides just simply holding a sufficient amount of cash in reserves with cushion, banks can also use term deposits to ensure that those reserves are more stable. Higher quality deposits are an effective means of reducing the overall risk of a bank's loan portfolio, or balance sheet. Essentially, term deposits offer higher rates to depositors, but the catch is that the term deposit cannot be withdrawn for a period of time. If it is withdrawn early, there will be a penalty imposed. In conclusion, term deposits, or CDs, are an important way for banks to reduce risk, and it is important for them to effectively target customers who may be interested in such securities. "

    "## Test for Imbalance\n",
    ">Before the model can be split into train and test datasets, the dataset needs to be assessed for imbalance. If the dataset is imbalanced, then it may be difficult to predict the target variable in a meaningful way using traditional scoring techniques. Another name for this type of issue in a classification model is rare event prediction. Imbalance can be expressed as a simple ratio. Technically, anything other than equal representation is considered imbalanced, but slight imbalance is not a significant problem. For our purposes, a ratio less than 0.2 will be considered imbalanced. In other words, if less than 20% of the observations in our dataset have a value of 'yes' or 1 in the target column, then the dataset will be considered significantly imbalanced and adjustments will be necessary.<br><br>\n",
    "In order to adjust for imbalance, a different scoring method will be used to assess each model. The roc_auc_score method will be used because it accounts for recall and the FPR (False Positive Rate). It is important to maximize the recall in whatever model is finally selected because it will ensure that a sufficient number of the most likely customers to subscribe to a term deposit are marketed to. The recall measures how many out of all of the positive target variables are correctly calssified. Also, we want to minimize the FPR because it wastes the bank's money too market to those who are unlikely to subscribe to a term deposit.\n"

    "> This dataset is significantly imbalanced, so adjustments will have to be made. Specifically, the scoring method used throughout this notebook for each classification model will be the roc_auc_score method in the sklearn package. This scoring method aims to maximize the recall, while minimizing the false positive rate. The interpretation of this for the bank is that this new scoring function will aim to minimize the number of customers who are marketed to who are unlikely to subscribe to a term deposit."

    "Importantly, the MinMaxScaler() function will be applied to the data at the same time as the train/test split. The MinMaxScaler() function is a commonly used regularization function which transforms all variables in each column to a value between 0-1 relative to other values in that variable. Regularization is applied to ensure that every factor in the dataset is weighed equally when distance-based classification models are applied. In models like support vector machines, the distance between points matters as that is the technique used to classify the data. Furthermore, Regularization will not affect non-distance-based calssification models. Therefore, standardization of the data is a critical first step regardless of whether classification or regression models are employed. "
